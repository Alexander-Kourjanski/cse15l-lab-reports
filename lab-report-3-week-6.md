# Lab Report 3: Copying Entire Directories With scp -r

One nice thing that the command line can do is copy an entire directory into a remote server account with just 1 command, and that is with the command scp -r. By doing so, all the files are copied in the same folders as they are on the main computer. Let us run through this process with the directory [markdown-parse](https://github.com/Alexander-Kourjanski/markdown-parse).
