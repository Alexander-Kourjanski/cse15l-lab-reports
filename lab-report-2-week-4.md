# Case 1: Characters In Between Close Bracket and Open Parentheses

When looking through the code of MarkdownParse.java, we realized that there was something that seemed off. The code inside the while loop looks for 4 things, open bracket, close bracket, open parentheses, and close parentheses in that order. What the code did not account for was what goes between each of these characters. The space between the parentheses is the link, and the space between the brackets is the text that the link will be hyperlinked into, but what about the space in between the close bracket and open parentheses? There should be no space in between them for the bracket and parentheses to qualify as a link since there could be markdown features that use only brackets, and other features that use only parentheses. Of course, being suspicious of code will not determine if the code has a bug or not without a proper test. The file [InBetween](https://alexander-kourjanski.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/InBetween.md) was created to test if this hypothesis was true, and the terminal verified that the code we had currently could have any number of characters between the close bracket and open parentheses, and still think that there is a link to take.

The condition that the open parentheses has to have an index one greater than the index of the close bracket was implemented, and that solved the issue.
